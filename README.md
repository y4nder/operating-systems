# 🖥️ Operating Systems

This repository is my personal attempt to simulate Operating System concepts in Python, based on what I have learned during my Operating Systems class.

The purpose of this project is to create simple, educational implementations of classic OS techniques — making them easier to study, experiment with, and understand. It’s meant for students like me, hobbyists, and anyone curious about how an operating system works under the hood.

📌 This project is still growing — more Operating System concepts and algorithms will be added over time.
